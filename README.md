# function_drawing_tool
A program that takes user's input (like sin(x) * cos(x)) and draws a function of this input's expression.

After running the program follow the instructions that appear. 
The input expression has to be of the kind: sin(3 * x) / cos(sqrt(x)) * tan(x)^-1.

Those variants will lead to panic:
- sinx,
- cos(3x),
- 2cos(x).

Program supports such mathematical functions as:
- Trigonometry: sin, cos, tan, tan^-1,
- asin, acos, atan,
- exp, ln, log10, sqrt, abs.
